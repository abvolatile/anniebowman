      			<p id="intro">On April 19th we lost Janet Marie Bowman - our “Wild Irish Rose”, wife, mother, grandmother, sister, friend and confidant.</p>

      			<p><em>She was born on August 4</em>, 1948 to Fred and Maxine Griffin in Ottumwa, IA, the second of four children. After graduating from Walsh High School in 1966 she attended St. Joseph’s School of Nursing at Creighton University, then finished her education at Gonzaga University in Spokane, WA with her MSN in Nurse Anesthesia in 1975. She worked for 40 years as a nurse at Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane, retiring in early 2015. Her commitment to her profession and her sense of humor endeared her to everyone she encountered both at work and in daily life.</p>

      			<p><em>Jan met her husband John</em> on a blind date at the Park Inn across the street from SHMC. They were married in April 1978 and had two children, Annie Marie and Peter Griffin Bowman. Jan spent nearly every summer with her husband, family and friends at their cabin on Lake Coeur d’Alene enjoying the weather and entertaining everyone with the latest recipes, party tricks, funny quotes, card games and late night shenanigans. She made sure the winter trips to Palm Desert with John and close friends were unforgettable.</p>

      			<p><em>Her compassion for the underprivileged</em> found an outlet in supporting the nonprofit organizations Reach for the Future and Miryam’s House. She loved to debate current issues and was very enthusiastic about politics, attending the Democratic National Convention in 2012. She was an avid reader, loved golf, snow skiing, hosting get-togethers, magic tricks and chardonnay. She had a talent for photography and home movies and spent countless hours creating videos set to her favorite music leaving behind memories of the lives she loved.</p>

      			<p><em>Jan is survived by</em> her husband John Bowman, her children Annie and Peter, her grandchildren Raven and Justice, her siblings Mike Griffin of Goshen, IN, Barbara Walters of Des Moines, IA, and Judy Ogier of Colorado Springs, CO, as well as many nieces, nephews and cousins.</p>

      			<p><em>Jan would have been overjoyed</em> by the amount of people who showed up to celebrate her life at the Park Inn on Sunday, April 24th 2016. Words cannot describe her family’s gratitude for all the flowers, cards and endless expressions of love and friendship they have received.</p>
